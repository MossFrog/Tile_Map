# Tile_Map
A template Visual studio project for anyone who wants to use TMX tilemaps in SFML.


##Above is an Template Visual Studio Project for those who want to use Fallahn's SFML TMXLoader [source code](https://github.com/fallahn/sfml-tmxloader).

The "TileTest" Folder contains the whole project with both libraries linked and a working example demonstrating how the camera can be panned within a loaded map. The project is completely portable and plug and play so you can download it and even run it off a flash drive on any PC that has the Visual Studio IDE!

The "Demo" Folder contains the compiled executable of the project.

The arrow keys can be used to pan the camera.

Great thanks to Matt Styles for all his help and assistance.

Good Luck with your development and dont forget to leave a Star!
